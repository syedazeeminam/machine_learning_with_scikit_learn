**_Some Important Definitions:_**

**Machine Learning:** Machine learning gives computers the ability to learn and extract useful insights from the given data. It has enabled the humans to extract meaning information from the data without being explicitly programmed.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

Machine Learning is mainly classified into following types: 
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

When considering the supervised learning in which the target variables are known, it can be used to solve two different types of problems i.e., 
1. _Regression Problems:_ Here, the target variable is continuous in nature.
2. _Classification Problems:_ Here, the target variable is categorical in nature.
