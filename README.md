# Machine Learning with Scikit Learn
This repository is based on the course "Machine Learning with Scikit Learn" offered by DataCamp. 

**_Some Important Definitions:_**

**Machine Learning:** Machine learning allows computers to learn and extract useful insights from the given data. It has enabled humans to extract meaningful information from the data without being explicitly programmed.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

Machine Learning is mainly classified into the following types: 
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

When considering the supervised learning in which the target variables are known, it can be used to solve two different types of problems i.e., 
1. _Regression Problems:_ Here, the target variable is continuous.
2. _Classification Problems:_ Here, the target variable is categorical. 

**Some Important Points Before Applying Supervised Learning Model(s)**

1. Make sure that data does not have missing values. For this, you may use the .info() method in Python.
2. Make sure the data is in numeric format. For this, you can look for help from the results of the .info() method called previously.
3. While in Python, it is important to ensure the data is stored as a NumPy array or in Pandas DataFrame.

In general, it is extremely important to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before applying any machine learning algorithm.
