# Sequence of steps for executing a machine learning model using sci-kit learn

# First import the desired model 
from sklearn.module import [Insert name of Model e.g. Model]

#Instantiate the model 
my_model = Model()

# Fit the training data using the instance of the model you just created
my_model.fit(X,y) # Here 'X' represents feature variables and 'y' represents the target variable in the traning data

# Predict the outputs of model 
pred = my_model.predict(X_test)  # Here X_test represents the feature variables for the testing data
